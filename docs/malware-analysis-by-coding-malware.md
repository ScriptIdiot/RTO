## Intro

Hands-on Malware Analysis by Coding Malware: <https://www.udemy.com/course/hands-on-malware-analysis-by-coding-malware/learn/lecture/21553238#overview>

### Key Concepts

* Types of malware
    * Worms: self replicating
    * Rootkits: privileged access
    * RAT: remote access (metasploit)
    * Downloader
    * Ransomware
    * Adware
    * Keyloggers
    * Botnets
    * Trojan: disguised as regular program

* Malware components
  * Payload: core component, malicious action
  * Obfuscator: packer/encrypt/compress malware
  * Persistence: stay on the system
  * Stealth component: hide malware from AV
  * Armorning: protect malware from AV, debugging, decompilers, disassembler
  * CC: comand and control to control/exfiltrate data (often uses TOR)

 * Getting malware onto a system
   * Social engineering, infected sites/files
   * Dropper installs malware
   * Payload installed

 * Prevention
   * Use AV
   *  Show hidden extensions in windows
   * Privileged admin, least access
   * Data backup
   * Check removable media
   * Humans are the weakest link
   * Prove defenses (https://www.knowbe4.com/ransomware-simulator = ransomware simulator)
